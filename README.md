The code is designed to be easy to understand and modify. The `MagicalArena` class represents the game arena, and the `Player` class represents a player in the game. The `startMatch` method in `MagicalArena` starts the game, and the `rollDie` method simulates the rolling of a 6-sided die.

The unit tests are located in the `MagicalArenaTest` and `PlayerTest` classes, and can be run using a JUnit test runner.
